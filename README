GOAL:
The goal of this project is to implemnt the MySQL wire protocol in Go,
mostly for my own amusement but it might become usable as a client 
library for other Go projects.

The wire protocol is documented here: 
 http://forge.mysql.com/wiki/MySQL_Internals_ClientServer_Protocol

STATUS:
Very simple queries should work. See test.go for example. 
No support for Unix Sockets yet.

Output of test:
Connected to 5.0.77-1
Response = OK, Affected Rows = 1, Insert Id = 11, Server Status = 2
Response = OK, Affected Rows = 1, Server Status = 2
